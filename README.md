## Features

- Clean & preprocess text: tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization/stemming  
- Sentiment classification using:
  - Rule-based approach (e.g., VADER, TextBlob)
  - Machine learning (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)
  - Deep learning (e.g., LSTM, BERT – optionally enabled)  
- Support for batching & streaming data  
- Visualizations: plots of sentiment distributions, confusion matrices, word clouds
